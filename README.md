### Course Description
This course examines more advanced topics in object-oriented programming with C++ such as dynamic memory allocation, various data structures, recursion, and object-oriented design.

#### Project: Classes and Objects
This is a program that stores information about books in a library. _Private attributes_ are used to store the book's ID, author, title and year. _Public methods_ are used to search and display book information.

#### Project: Linked List
This is a program that utilizes _linked lists_ to store information about books in a library. Book information can be inserted, searched and sorted by manipulating pointers to iterate through the inked list.

#### Project: Binary Tree
This is a program that utilizes a _binary tree data structure_ to store information about books in a library. Each node in the data structure has a _left_ and _right_ node pointer to create the binary structure. _Recursion_ is used to traverse the binary tree for insertion, sorting, and searching.
