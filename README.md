### Course Description
This course examines more advanced topics in object-oriented programming with C++ such as dynamic memory allocation, various data structures, recursion, and object-oriented design.

#### Project: Classes and Objects
This is a program that stores information about books in a library. Private attributes are used to store the book's ID, author, title and year. Public methods are used to search and display book information.

#### Project: Linked List
This is a program that utilizes linked lists to store information about books in a library. Book information can be inserted, searched and sorted by manipulating pointers to iterate through the inked list.

#### Project: Binary Tree
This is a program that utilizes a binary tree data structure to store information about books in a library. Each node in the data structure has a **left** and **right** node pointer to create the binary structure. Recursion is used to traverse the binary tree for insertion, sorting, and searching.
